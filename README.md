# OreoBuild: Advanced C++ Build System

OreoBuild is a powerful, flexible, and high-performance build system entirely written in C++ for C and C++ projects. It aims to provide an integrated and efficient build process, leveraging the full capabilities of C++ to create a tool that's both powerful and familiar to its users.

## Core Concept

A build system that allows developers to define build logic directly in C++, eliminating the need for a separate build script language.

## Key Features

- **Pure C++ Implementation**: All configuration and build logic defined in C++
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, Unix-like systems, and bare metal
- **Runtime Optimizations**: Faster builds through intelligent optimizations
- **Modular Design**: Highly maintainable structure with multiple files

## Advantages

1. **Familiar Environment**: Direct use of C++ for build logic
2. **High Performance**: Leverages C++ for efficient build processes
3. **Flexibility**: Handles complex build scenarios with ease
4. **C Compatibility**: Backwards compatible with C projects

## Unique Aspects

- **Bare Metal Support**: Generate builds for systems without an OS
- **Feature Flags**: Compile-time and runtime optimizations
- **C++ Plugins**: Extensibility through a robust plugin system

## Target Users

C and C++ developers seeking a powerful, flexible, and fast build system without the need to learn a new build script language.

## Core Design

1. **Pure C++ Development**: Entire system written in C++
2. **Integrated Build Logic**: No separate build script language
3. **Modular Structure**: Multiple files for organization and maintainability

## Build Configuration

- C++ code defines build configuration, compiled with the project
- Utilizes C++ templates and metaprogramming for type-safe configurations
- Supports complex build logic directly in C++

## Cross-Platform Support

- Abstract interfaces for Windows, Unix-like, and bare metal systems
- Runtime environment detection
- Conditional compilation for platform-specific features

## Bare Metal Support

- Builds for systems without an operating system
- Direct hardware interaction capabilities
- Embedded systems and microcontroller support

## Feature Flagging System

- Compile-time flags for major feature toggling
- Runtime flags for dynamic build behavior adjustments
- Efficient flag checking mechanisms

## Performance Optimizations

- Leverages modern C++ features for high-performance builds
- Multi-threading support for parallel builds
- Intelligent caching and incremental build system

## Extensibility

- C++ plugin system for custom build steps
- Event-driven architecture for build process customization
- Support for embedded domain-specific languages

## Dependency Management

- Built-in dependency resolution
- Version control integration (Git, SVN, etc.)
- Handles system-wide and project-local dependencies

## Compiler and Toolchain Integration

- Support for multiple compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Cross-compilation capabilities
- Abstraction layer for consistent toolchain interface

## Runtime Optimizations

- Dynamic adjustment of build parameters based on system resources
- Just-in-time compilation of build scripts
- Lazy evaluation of build rules
